<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>
    I'm from Nashik, and I'm a Computer Engineering student at the Government College of Engineering and Research Avasari
    and was a member at the Robotics Research Lab. I had been working in robotics. In my spare time, I like working on
    my strengths. I am open to work in opportunities related to my skillset or wherever get to learn any new technologies.
